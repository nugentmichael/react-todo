# React To-Do List App

This is a simple To-Do List web application built using the ReactJS framework.

Each list item is stored within a parent JSON array, which is then saved as a Local Storage object in the browser to retain the state of your list.

### Features To Implement

* Drag-and-Drop item placement
* List categories (shopping, personal, etc.)
* Upgrade from saving items in a Local Storage object to a database schema in [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
